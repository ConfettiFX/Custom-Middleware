Ephemeris 2 is a middleware solution for implementing a dynamic 24 hour Skydome System. It is running on top of [The Forge](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge) and therefore supports all the platforms this framework supports.

Check out the demo video by clicking the main image above!

## Main Features

  - Dynamic 24 hour time cycle (sunrises, sunsets, blue sky, sun and moon)
  - Atmospheric Scattering
  - Volumetric Clouds
  - Godrays
  - Procedural Night Sky and Star-field 
  - Simulation of astronomically correct sun, stars and moon (coming soon)
  - 2.5D Clouds for mobile (coming soon with Ephemeris 1)
