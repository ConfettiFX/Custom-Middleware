Ephemeris 2 is a middleware solution for implementing a dynamic 24 hour Skydome System. It is running on top of [The Forge](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge) and therefore supports the same platforms. We will release Ephemeris 1 for the iOS / Android mobile platforms in the future.

Check out the demo video by clicking the main image above!

 ```

The release version of Ephemeris and the release version of The Forge need to be the same.
