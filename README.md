Ephemeris 2 is a middleware solution for implementing a dynamic 24 hour Skydome System. It is running on top of [The Forge](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge) and therefore supports the same platforms. We will release Ephemeris 1 for the iOS / Android mobile platforms in the future.

Check out the demo video by clicking the main image above!

## Main Features

  - Dynamic 24 hour time cycle (sunrises, sunsets, blue sky, sun and moon)
  - Atmospheric Scattering

  - Godrays
  - Procedural Night Sky and Star-field 
  - Simulation of astronomically correct sun, stars and moon (coming soon)
